Ken is
incredibly knowledgeable about the network security industry and will be a great resource, especially if you&rsquo;re interested
in working at a company like F5. He may be joining us on-campus in the near future, and if so, he&rsquo;ll use our questions
here to decide what his topic will be.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a bit about Ken:</p><pre><code>Ken Arora is a senior architect in F5’s Office of the CTO, focusing on addressing real-world customer needs in the 
network and application security area.  One technology area Ken champions at F5 is improving operational usability by 
focusing on customer workflows.  He advocates the use of statistical analysis, heuristics, and machine learning to 
provide the broader context of the application’s posture and the current state and risks.  Another key area of focus 
is the use of hardware/software codesign to enable new approaches to application protection that are impractical using
software alone.  
 
Two of Ken’s current projects:  
    • Bringing to market a new highly scalable platform that delivering hardware-accelerated networking and security 
    features, within the context of a Kubernetes compatible ecosystem.  
    • Defining a data architecture and processing pipeline, in support of enabling AI-assisted operations and advanced
     analytics, fed by the immense amount of data telemetry available using F5 platforms.  
     
Prior to F5, Mr. Arora co-founded a company that developed a solution for ASIC-accelerated pattern matching, which was
then acquired by Cisco, where he was the technical architect for the Cisco ASA Product Family.  In his more distant 
past, he was also the architect for several Intel microprocessors.  

Ken enjoys playing hockey, but when off the ice, he also spends time on the board of Silicon Valley Shakespeare and is
a superforecaster for the Good Judgement project.
