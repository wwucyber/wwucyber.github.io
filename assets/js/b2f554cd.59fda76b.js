Not only does he give an excellent historical perspective, but also a great technical one.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe content regarding Alan Turing life and also Quantum Cryptography were the most thought provoking for me. The idea of a cipher that in order to be broke, the very laws that dictate our understanding of the universe but also be broken is tremendous to me. The great but also tragic life of Alan Turning was the chapter that effected me the most, a genius of cryptography whose life was cut short by a barbaric government.\\n\\nI highly recommend this book to the aspiring Cryptographer and Historian alike."}]}')}}]);
